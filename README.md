## Motivation
This project was created in order to learn more about Vue changes from version 2 to 3 and practice the setup of a scalable VueJs project.

## How to play
The objective of the game is to move all the pieces from one tower to another.
The only rule is that a piece can only be positioned on a bigger piece or an empty tower.
There is always a perfect solution, based on the number of pieces.
The number of movements on a perceft solution can be found trought:
```
 2 ^ n + 1
```
Where 'n' is the number of pieces in the game.
